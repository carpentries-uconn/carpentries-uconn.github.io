				<h3>Join Us!</h3>
				<p>We are a group of students, postdoc, staff, and faculty who are committed to building a community of excellence at the University of Michigan around the area of reproducible data analysis. As a Carpentries Partner Organization, we use two day Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops to help members of the University of Michigan community to grow in their computer programming skills. From these workshops we seek to build a community of excellence by training people to become workshop helpers and instructors. Also, we continue to engage learners by offering specialty workshops that go deeper into content or explore topics not covered by the typical Carpentries workshops.</p>
				<p>Join our <a href=https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:Software%20Carpentry%20Updates>MCommunity email group</a> to get updates about upcoming workshops and other opportunities.</p>
